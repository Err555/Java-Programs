## Java MCQA Practice Repository

Welcome to the Java MCQA Practice Repository! This collection of Java projects is designed to help you prepare for Multiple Choice Questions and Coding Challenges, especially focusing on finding output and correcting errors. Many questions are inspired by Indiabix.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into 10 directories within `src` directory, each correspond to specific Test. Navigate to the relevant directory to access the programs for particular test.

### Test 1
- [BenTest 1](/src/BenTest1)

### Test 2
- [BenTest 2](/src/BenTest2/)

...

### Test 10
- [BenTest 10](/src/BenTest10/)

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
